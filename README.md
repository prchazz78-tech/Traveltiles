# Prompt to Prototype Vibe Coding Challenge Starter

The SkillUp AI **Prompt to Prototype** is a fast-paced AI-powered creation challenge.  
In one hour, you’ll take an idea from a concept to a working **web-based prototype** using Copilot, Researcher Agent, GitHub Copilot, or no-code React-based builders.

You’ll go through **six key stages**:

1.  Ideation — get or refine your idea
    
2.  Research — validate and explore your concept
    
3.  PRD — define your product requirements
    
4.  Branding — give your product a look, feel, and personality
    
5.  Prototype — build your MVP
    
6.  Submit — package your work for sharing

## Tips

- Delete anything you don't need. Keep it **lean**.
- Use the **Prompts** inside `.github/copilot-instructions.md` as your running chat with Copilot.
- Aim for a **single, clear MVP** first (one page, one core action).
- If you need routing later, add it (e.g., `react-router-dom`) *after* your MVP works. If you want to submit your project to be aggregated, you need to use HashRouter.
